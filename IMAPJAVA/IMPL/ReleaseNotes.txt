CMailbox.java
-------------
Implementation of IMailbox interface


  Notes on Following 

    public boolean   IsNewMailAvailable() 
    public int getNewMailCount()
 
        Won't Work as of Now because of certain side effects
        which these Calls may have on the Server State. The 
        JavaMail Provider given by the Sun is not able to set
        the Messages as ANSWERED or DRAFT. ony option it 
        allows is DELETE ( at least with a POP server ).
        Check whether this works with IMAP.   

    public IMail[] getNewMails()
        Is not Working properly with the Current Provider
        supplied with the Sun. we are not able to set
        the Filter . ( See the implementation )
